>>
CohenEffectSize(firsts.prglngth, others.prglngth)  : 0.028879044654449883

CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb) : -0.088672927072602006

In both cases the effect size is small relative difference between men and women heights given as an example in the book. However, there is a slight negative effect in the birth weight, which means that the mean weights of the first born child is slightly (not by much) lower than the other children.
